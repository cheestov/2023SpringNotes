# Lecture:
if people are opressed do we have the right to free them ?
- John stuart Mills , quoted by Walzer, says that it is during an arduous struggle for freedom that the free virtues are built from
	- Moving a tyrant does not pave the way for freedom
	- leader that intervenes must prove that they are doing good
	- A people have the right to suffer only at their own hand

Lubin points out that walzer says that a liberal revolution Killed and the people punished is democratic or whatever because it is interned political struggle
	- should not shrug off the possibility of a succesful intervention and deposing of a dictator 

Walzer's rules of intervention: 
	1. Save states about to be unjustly attacked 
	2. If you want to support a secessionist movement with a legitimate claim to control that territory
	3. help a people under threat of a great massacre 

Walzer says that Vietnam Was their Own War to win or lose is an example of intervention that went wrong.

difficulties by walker: 
- the secessionists Might lose the support of the people
- the losses might be too high to justify the intervention

Lubin is a cool individualist who beleives in human rights 

Walzer's humanitarian principles : 
	1 don't hurt people
	 2. what is morally good is not always required Intervention 

Criteria by Someone else: 
1. The burden of proof is on the intervener
2. Last resort criterion 
3. A right-intention intervention 
4. should have a legitimate authority ready for when war is over


# Recitation Reading:

## Walzer: case against libyan intervention
### Libyan Intervention Concerns

-   Unclear purpose of the intervention: no endgame, no agreement on the goal of the attack
-   Lack of significant Arab support: only 1% representation from Qatar and UAE, no support from Tunisia and Egypt
-   Not a humanitarian intervention to stop a massacre
-   Overthrow of tyrants and establishment of democracy should be local work
-   Military attack defensible only in extreme cases, such as Rwanda and Darfur

## Galston: case against cast against Libya
### Humanitarian Interventions

-   A noted political philosopher, Michael Walzer, wrote about humanitarian interventions in 1977 and 1999
-   In 1977, he argued that when a government turns savagely on its own people, a state capable of stopping the slaughter has the right to try to do so
-   In 1999, he noted that the greatest danger people face is from their own states and the dilemma of international politics is whether people in danger should be rescued by military forces from the outside
-   He argued that there have been unjustified refusals to intervene, leading people to look for a better form of agency
-   He offered reasons why humanitarian interventions under U.N. auspices might meet the standard

### Critique of Intervention in Libya

-   Walzer critiques the intervention in Libya and starts with three prudential points: unclear purpose, lack of Arab support, and international opposition
-   The author agrees with Walzer but disagrees with his critique of the intervention in Libya
-   Walzer argues that this is not a humanitarian intervention to stop a massacre but the author argues that the threat to innocent life in Libya is extreme enough to justify the intervention

### Moral Justification

-   The author argues that there is good reason why President Obama acted to prevent a humanitarian disaster that is probable but not absolutely certain
-   The author cites the example of Rwanda to argue that if outside parties wait until the murder begins, it may be too late to halt it before many thousands have died
-   The author argues that "can implies ought" and because the U.S. can act in ways that others can't, it is not as free as they are to ignore threats that it has the power to abate
-  The author cites the example of a skilled swimmer who hears a cry for assistance and observes someone struggling in the water as a philosopher's example to clarify the issue

### Humanitarian Protection

-   The author grants a point that Walzer makes that humanitarian protection is one thing but regime change is quite another
