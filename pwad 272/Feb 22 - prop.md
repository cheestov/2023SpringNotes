# ChatGPT Summary:
### Proportionality

-   General formula (fotion?): maximize military benefits and minimize evil
-   Destruction caused must not be out of proportion to the object in war
-   Ad bellum proportionality condition: destructiveness of war must not be out of proportion to the relevant good of the war
-   In bello proportionality condition: civilian casualties must not be more excessive than military advantage gained from the act

### Criteria and Responsibility

-   Determine relevant goods and evils in favor of the war
-   Weigh goods and evils against each other

### Soldiers vs Civilians

-   Soldiers are not worth a lot in these considerations
-   Civilian casualties must not be more excessive than military advantage gained
-   Soldiers are legit targets, while civilians are not
-   National partiality exists, but commander should still protect enemy civilians

### Other Points

-   Proportionality allows for more extreme measures against genocidal enemies
-   Consider present and future threats, not just damages already done  
-   War proportionality and in-battle proportionality exist
-   Train soldiers to make virtuous decisions

# Lecture:

Proportionality
1. Proportionality and utility
	 General formula (fotion ? ) :
	- aximize the Military benefits and minimize evil
	-  In war this means that the destruction caused must not be out of proportion to the object

	Ad bellum proportionality condition:
	- the destructiveness of war must not be out of proportion to the relevant good of the war

	in bello proportionality condition:
	-  Civilian casualties are worth more and need to not be more excessive then the military advantage gained from the act

2. criteria, who is responsible? 
	- what are the revelost good that count in fever off the war ?
	-  what are the relevant evils ?
	- How do these weigh against eachother

3. Soldiers v civilians
	- Soldiers are not worth a lot in these considerations
	- seems like we can kill any Number of soldiers for the reason of protecting your own soldiers
	- Our civilian are worth more then their civilians, but we should still protect their civilians
	principle of discrimination:
	- soldier are legit targets while Civilians are not
	- but a commander should value his own soldiers Over enemy civilians
		- National partiality

- proportionality suggests that against a genocidal enemy we are allowed to do almost anything
- in proportionality calculations we consider present and future threats
	- it is about the threat they pose, not the damages already done

- there is war proportionality and in battle proportionality
	- train Soldiers to make vitreous decisions
