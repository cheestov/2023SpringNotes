Fictitious Marriage
- Imaginary Unity
- Jacque Lacan (psycho-analysis weirdo like Freud ) - Says that the Subconscious is structured like langauge
	- Talks about the imaginary ( mother) and the symbolic (father )
	- Something about when toddlers have no language and no ego they sense that their mother is a part of themselves (imaginary)
	- Something about how langauge has only symbolic meaning? (symbolic)
		- The Nation is Symbolic like the rest of language
		- Contemporary Cinema starts to bring nationalism into a more imaginary/Organic discourse

- " 1966 was a good year for tourism" (because there was a war the next year)
	- Certain kind of nostalgia that includes conveniently forgetting the horrors of Israel's existence

- Movie has fluidity
	- the main character has many different identities that spans experiences with other ethnicities
		- Creates a diagetic exploration of passing or casting in Isreali Cinema
		- "passing" as other ethnic groups is currently a liberal idea in Isreali Cinema
			- by encouraging "passing" we actually solidify stereotypes and rigidity of the ethnicities and nationalities.
- An isreali woman has slept with a palestinian : fluidity with social strata or status
	- Even though its actually an Israeli pretending to be a palestinian. This creates a world in the film where it is actually impossible for a jew to sleep with an arab.

- Susu was the most popular arab children's show in Isreal for a while. Was a puppet show
