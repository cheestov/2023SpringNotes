### Lecture:

Side note: Oriental-jew = Arab-jew
Is 5BC an Israeli film or a Palestinian film?
- Isreali Money , Crew, and influence
- It's a Palestinians story and he filmed it

- Only film where two directors , one of which is Isreali-jew and the others from Occupied palestine

Extra notes on Palestinian cinema:
- Has early Nationalist Cinema
- heavy use of National symbols like the olive tree, Or a key which is a symbol for the home that was stolen from them
- generally very critical of the Isreali state
- focuses on the conflict for Isreali independence
- Elia Suleman, Famous Film maker Turned The symbolism into a farce for a reason or something
- Post- Modernist way of Poking fun at nationalist concepts

5BC discussion:
- strong themes of the Palestinian connection to the land
- the isreali director wrote the script
- issue of who speaks for who? Does the Oppressor speak for the Oppressed
- is it possible that The film maker could not explain his own trauma? Did he need someone else who was far away from the trauma to write it
- Isreali Wipes away the idea that the trauma never ends, he creates a beginning middle and end

Contemporary Cinema:
- Thematically, it shows more diverse groups In and outside of isreal
- far less focused on the Arab - Israeli Conflict
- will show relatively more of jewish religious practices
-Alot of emphasis on domestic issues. Heavy films On domestic Violence
- Films used to be outside, especially the battle field, Now they are often indoors
- exemplifies the gradual shift to looking inwards more

-  Israeli Cinema tries to reflect the national identity at that point, but it is always changing
- identity politics can also make this complicated. Less of an idea now that there is a connected national identity
