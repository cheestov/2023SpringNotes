# Movie:
- set in the 30's I think and follows a Ukranian boy who was born before Lenin took over
- they believed that the bolshevik revolution would mean an age of freedom for Ukraine, but as it goes, their freedom is brief before the soviets invade again
- When stalin takes power they decide to collectivise Ukraine, russia needs its grain and mineral wealth to survive
- they say they will implement the plan with no mercy
- the movie is far too heroic at this point, there was never a chance for the Ukranians
- very bright and colourful but it may be about showing how beautiful Ukraine is
- from the preist: the soviets are already living in hell
- Stalin knew he was committing a genocide
- the party hides the famine, even Ukranians in Kiev are tricked by this lie. this is the false reality that the western reporters are allowed to see
- all colour is gone in Ukraine because they are so sad
- "great hopes for our future"
