# Movie:
- set in the 30's I think and follows a Ukranian boy who was born before Lenin took over
- they believed that the bolshevik revolution would mean an age of freedom for Ukraine, but as it goes, their freedom is brief before the soviets invade again
- When stalin takes power they decide to collectivise Ukraine, russia needs its grain and mineral wealth to survive
- they say they will implement the plan with no mercy
- the movie is far too heroic at this point, there was never a chance for the Ukranians
- very bright and colourful but it may be about showing how beautiful Ukraine is
- from the preist: the soviets are already living in hell
- Stalin knew he was committing a genocide
- the party hides the famine, even Ukranians in Kiev are tricked by this lie. this is the false reality that the western reporters are allowed to see
- all colour is gone in Ukraine because they are so sad
- "great hopes for our future"

# Lecture:

non-combatant immunity

- Soldiers
- Walzer says that soldiers consent to becoming dangerous people. because he is a dangerous man, he becomes endangered
- also says that they are people who generally want to avoid injury and make it home safely.

- Civilians
- there are Many Civilians who are caught in the war effort. Cooks, factory workers, scientist, etc.
- does this make them legitimate war targets ?
- terror on civilians is not included in this, for example : the bombing in Ukraine or the Nopalm bombing in Tokyo

Doctrine of double effect:
- You should not intend on killing many civilians
1. the act itself must be morally good or atleast in different
2. the direct effect is morally acceptable
3. the intention of the actor is good, his aim is only the acceptable end
4. the good effect must be sufficiently good tto outweigh whatever bad effect

Walzer's revisions:
3. the actor must have good intent and be trying to Minimize the evil effect. the evil must not be his means or his ends
