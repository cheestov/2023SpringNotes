Morag - Waltz with Bashir

- film paints his feeling of guilt not from being complicit in a genocide but from childhood memories of the holocaust
- Comes from the connection of camps in both Lebanon and the holocaust
- this transfer from perpetrator to victim permits his refusal to acknowledge his responsibilty in the events
-Showing the archival footage undeniably proves the crime but it leaves us without an acknowledgment of the perpetrators including the Isrealis

z 32 reading :
-3 levels of trauma
- trauma of narrativisation
- the perpetrator fails to tell his own story in full , tries to put the responsibility onto his gF and the filmaker who all tell the story to the audience in different ways
-by making the film More meta, the film doesn't allow us to become emotionally invested in the characters so we don't want to exonerate the perpetrator , instead he wants to implicate himself
- some other ones that don't matter as much
- the style of z 32 accepts that trauma cannot tell a linear story in its narrative Style

# Lecture:
War and Victimhood
- important note from Freud: repressed trauma never reappears as the way that it actually is
- is this perhaps the origin of the dream of standing in the Ocean watching the flairs over Beirut ?
- this is why it is difficult to present a story through trauma : There is no timeline in trauma, no resolution Or necessarily always true
- more psychoanalysis : the more you remember Something the less you actually remember the event. You overwrite your own memories and change them or fill in missing parts subconsciously
vvvvvvvvvvv Therefore
 Waltz with Bashir is a projection of the Holocaust onto the modern subject matter and is a poor representation of actual memory

Waltz with Bashir
- tried to portray the soldiers as too young to have made their own choices during the conflict
- tries to seperate idf from responsibility of the massacre
- Separates the idf from the phalangists at multiple points
- the psychoanalyst tells him that he is not responsible because of his trauma from the holocaust , He will always be the victim, twisted logic that turns his own memory onto its head

# Lecture:
jus ad Vim:
- the moral language Used to describe some modern forms of war
- Change in modern warfare - less about state-state combat
- increase in enemies being non-state actors
-Geographic boundaries have became less important
- increased use of drones
- Cyber warfare
- stux net: made by USA and Isreal to stop Iran from enriching Uranium
- act of war that can't easily be traced to the source
- force Protection
- Allows for less friendly casualties
- less economic burden as well

Consequence
- increases support for the non -state actor
- brings international or national criticism to the state

American View
- Dick Cheney says, in regional conflicts we need to be decisive with minimal casualties
- we no longer see them as conflicts with the survival of state at risk

principles of jus ad Vim:
1. Cannot start a war
2. For right reason
3. needs to be addressing a specific target or threat
4. More permissable than jus ad bellum
